<table>
	<tr><th>Abstract</th></tr>
	<tr><td>The <span class=product>rwt-favorites</span> DOM component uses the browser's local-storage facility to hold a website-specific list of favorite pages. Visitors can add or remove pages from the list using a popup dialog box.</td></tr>
</table>

### Motivation

When browsing for information, it's common to glance over page after page of
"not quite what I'm looking for" stuff. When you finally discover the gem you're
looking for, you naturally don't want to lose it.

Saving that page to your browser's list of favorites is a common way to keep
track of important URLs. Unfortunately, the browser's list of favorites tends to
get so cluttered over time that it's no longer useful.

This <span>rwt-favorites</span> DOM component is a way to give a
similar functionality to your visitors, but on a local website basis. Users can
save pages for later in-depth reading, or for follow-up work, or for ready
reference. It is most useful on large websites.

#### In the wild

To see an example of this component in use, visit the <a href='https://bluephrase.com'><span class=bp>BLUE</span><span class=phrase>PHRASE</span></a>
website and press <kbd>F8</kbd> "Favorites". To understand what's going on under
the hood, use the browser's inspector to view the HTML source code and network
activity, and follow along as you read this documentation.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

The <span>rwt-favorites</span> DOM component works in any browser that
supports modern W3C standards. Templates are written using <span>BLUE</span><span>
PHRASE</span> notation, which can be compiled into HTML using the free <a href='https://hub.readwritetools.com/desktop/rwview.blue'>Read Write View</a>
desktop app. It has no other prerequisites. Distribution and installation are
done with either NPM or via Github.

#### Download


<details>
	<summary>Download using NPM</summary>
	<p><b>OPTION 1:</b> Familiar with Node.js and the <code>package.json</code> file?<br />Great. Install the component with this command:</p>
	<pre lang=bash>
npm install rwt-favorites<br />	</pre>
	<p><b>OPTION 2:</b> No prior experience using NPM?<br />Just follow these general steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Install <a href='https://nodejs.org'>Node.js/NPM</a> on your development computer.</li>
		<li>Create a <code>package.json</code> file in the root of your web project using the command:</li>
		<pre lang=bash>
npm init<br />		</pre>
		<li>Download and install the DOM component using the command:</li>
		<pre lang=bash>
npm install rwt-favorites<br />		</pre>
	</ul>
	<p style='font-size:0.9em'>Important note: This DOM component uses Node.js and NPM and <code>package.json</code> as a convenient <i>distribution and installation</i> mechanism. The DOM component itself does not need them.</p>
</details>


<details>
	<summary>Download using Github</summary>
	<p>If you prefer using Github directly, simply follow these steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <code>node_modules</code> directory in the root of your web project.</li>
		<li>Clone the <span class=product>rwt-favorites</span> DOM component into it using the command:</li>
		<pre lang=bash>
git clone https://github.com/readwritetools/rwt-favorites.git<br />		</pre>
	</ul>
</details>

### Using the DOM component

After installation, you need to add four things to your HTML page to make use of
it.

   * Add a `script` tag to load the component's `rwt-favorites.js` file:
```html
<script src='/node_modules/rwt-favorites/rwt-favorites.js' type=module></script>             
```

   * Add the component tag somewhere on the page.

      * For scripting purposes, apply an `id` attribute.
      * Optionally, apply a `sourceref` attribute with a reference to a JSON file
         containing initial favorites.
      * And for WAI-ARIA accessibility apply a `role=search` attribute.
```html
<rwt-favorites id=favorites sourceref='/initial-favorites.json' role=search></rwt-favorites>             
```

   * Add a button for the visitor to click to show the dialog:
```html
<a id=favorite-button title='Favorites (F7)'>â˜…</a>
```

   * Add a listener to respond to the click event:
```html
<script type=module>
    document.getElementById('favorite-button').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        document.getElementById('favorites').toggleDialog(e);
    });
</script>
```


### Customization

#### Preset favorites

The JSON file referenced by the `sourceref` attribute is used to initialize the
local-storage area with "favorites" that you think are appropriate for
first-time visitors. It is only used the first time a visitor encounters this
component on any page in your website. It is ignored from then on.

The format for this JSON file follows this pattern:

```json
[
    {
      "filePath": "/page1.html",
      "title": "Page 1",
      "description": "The most important feature of this website",
      "star": true
    },
    {
      "filePath": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "star": true
    }
]
```

#### Dialog size and position

The dialog is absolutely positioned towards the bottom right of the viewport.
Its size may be overridden using CSS by defining new values for `--width` and `--height`
.

```css
rwt-favorites {
    --width: 70vw;
    --height: 50vh;
    --bottom: 1rem;
    --right: 1rem;
}
```

#### Dialog color scheme

The default color palette for the dialog uses a dark mode theme. You can use CSS
to override the variables' defaults:

```css
rwt-favorites {
    --color: var(--white);
    --accent-color1: var(--yellow);
    --accent-color2: var(--js-blue);
    --background: var(--black);
    --accent-background1: var(--medium-black);
    --accent-background2: var(--pure-black);
    --accent-background3: var(--nav-black);
    --accent-background4: var(--black);
}
```

### Internals

The visitor's favorites are stored in local-storage under the key `favorite-data`.

### Life-cycle events

The component issues life-cycle events.


<dl>
	<dt><code>component-loaded</code></dt>
	<dd>Sent when the component is fully loaded and ready to be used. As a convenience you can use the <code>waitOnLoading()</code> method which returns a promise that resolves when the <code>component-loaded</code> event is received. Call this asynchronously with <code>await</code>.</dd>
</dl>
